# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
Perform EDA on the Titanic dataset to understand feature distributions, correlations, and survival patterns using Python.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## 📁 Files Included
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv` - Raw dataset
- `titanic_eda.py` - Python script for EDA

## 📊 Key Steps in Analysis
1. Summary statistics of all features
2. Histograms & boxplots for numeric columns
3. Correlation matrix & pairplot
4. Interactive plot (Age vs Fare vs Survival)
5. Inference about outliers, trends, and survival relationships

## ✅ Insights
- Higher fare passengers had better survival rates
- Age has outliers but shows trends with survival
- Positive correlation between Parch/SibSp
- Data preprocessing helped improve visualization
